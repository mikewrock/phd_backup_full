\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost I would like to thank Dr. Scott Nokleby for his support, guidance, and insight. Without him and the \acrshort{mars} Laboratory I would not have been able to perform this research. His knowledge and experience was invaluable and working with him has kept my academic studies both fun and challenging. I couldn't have asked for a better supervisor and role model. Dr. Remon Pop-Iliev has been another major influence on my concept of what makes a great engineer. I thank him for the time he spent with me demonstrating what skills and traits contribute to being a well respected professional.\\

The hardware provided by Dr. Jing Ren was particularly useful, allowing me to maintain focus on research instead of sourcing parts.\\

I would like to thank Cameco Corporation, Martin Wacker, Alex Pop, Jason Hood, Scott Bishop, Brian Mattie, and the staff at the MacArthur River mine for taking the time to show me around the mine and demonstrate the shotcrete process. Their input and experience gave me a much better understanding of what value my work can offer.\\

I am grateful to Cameco Corporation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship for their financial support that made this work possible.\\
