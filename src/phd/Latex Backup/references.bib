abstract="3D terrestrial laser scanning is a relatively new, but already revolutionary, surveying technique. The survey yield a digital data set, which is essentially a dense ``point cloud'', where each point is represented by a coordinate in 3D space. The most important advantage of the method is that a very high point density can be achieved, in the order of 5 to 10 mm resolution. In order to analyse the character and shape of the scanned surfaces it is necessary to convert the irregularly distributed point data into 3D surface information using surface reconstruction. The reconstructed surface can subsequently be visualized using a variety of 3D visualization techniques. From the reconstructed 3D surfaces, it is also possible to generate 2D profiles or elevation contour lines for use in regular GIS or CAD packages. A number of applications are described in this paper, which may illustrate the possible benefits of using laser scanning as a technique in engineering geological practice and research: volume analysis and monitoring, detailed and large-scale topographic mapping, tunnelling, rock face surveying, and digital outcrop mapping.",

Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate.",

abstract = {Impact kinetic energy is well known to play a central and key role on rebound and consolidation mechanisms controlling the shotcrete placement process. While the impact velocity of the traveling particles at their exit of the nozzle has received some attention recently, the mass flow distribution of the sprayed material as it impacts the receiving surface remains unexplored despite its obvious importance on rebound. In this context, a novel apparatus that collects the sprayed material traveling out of the nozzle was developed; material spatial distribution and composition are brought forward. The incident mass flow of material was found to be denser in the central region around the spray axis and decrease toward the peripheral regions following a Gaussian-type function. Additionally, a cement-rich layer formed in the spray's peripheral zones is also revealed and its origins are discussed. In light of this work, an innovative and unique analytical characterization tool is proposed to further investigate the spraying process and to improve the understanding of shotcrete, and especially material losses through rebound.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach - WireWarping for computing a flattened planar piece with length-preserved feature curves from a 3D piecewise linear surface patch. The property of length-preservation on feature curves is very important to industrial applications for controlling the shape and dimension of products fabricated from planar pieces. WireWarping simulates warping a given 3D surface patch onto plane with the feature curves as tendon wires to preserve the length of their edges. During warping, the surface-angle variations between edges on wires are minimized so that the shape of a planar piece is similar to its corresponding 3D patch. Two schemes - the progressive warping and the global warping schemes are developed, where the progressive scheme is flexible for local shape control and the global scheme gives good performance on highly distorted patches. Experimental results show that WireWarping can successfully flatten surface patches into planar pieces while preserving the length of edges on feature curves. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Surface flattening has numerous applications in sheet manufacturing industries, such as garment industry, shoe industry, toy industry, furniture industry and ship industry. Motivated by the requirements of those industries,WireWarping approach presented in [1] is exploited to generate 2D patterns with invariant length of feature and boundary curves. However, strict length constraints on all feature curves sometimes cause large distortions on 2D patterns, especially for those 3D surfaces which are highly non-developable. In this paper, we present a flexible and robust extension of WireWarping by introducing a new type of feature curves named elastic feature, which brings flexibility to shape control of the resultant 2D patterns. On these new feature curves, instead of strictly preserving the exact lengths, only the ranges of their lengths are controlled. To achieve this function, a multi-loop shape control optimization framework is proposed to find the optimized 2D shape among all possible flattening results with different length variations on those elastic feature curves, while the lengths of other feature curves are kept unchanged. Besides, we also present a topology processing algorithm on the network of feature curves to eliminate cases that lead to numerical singularity. Experimental results show that the WireWarping++ can successfully flatten surface patches into 2D patterns with more flexible shape control and more robust numerical performance.},

abstract = {In many industries, products are constructed by assembled surface patches in ℜ3, where each patch is expected to have an isometric map to a corresponding region in ℜ2. The widely investigated developable surfaces in differential geometry show this property. However, the method to model a piecewise-linear surface with this characteristic is still under research. To distinguish from the continuous developable surface, we name them as flattenable mesh surfaces since a polygonal mesh has the isometric mapping property if it can be flattened into a two-dimensional sheet without stretching. In this paper, a novel flattenable mesh surface (Flattenable Laplacian mesh) is introduced and the relevant modelling tool is formulated. Moreover, for a given triangular mesh which is almost flattenable, a local perturbation approach is developed to improve its flattenability. The interference between the meshes under process and their nearby objects has been prevented in this local flattenable perturbation. Both the computations of Flattenable Laplacian meshes and the flattenable perturbation are based on the constrained optimization technology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper addresses the problem of planar parameterization, i.e., mapping a given triangulated surface onto a planar domain. We construct an optimized algorithm for parameterization of genus-zero meshes and aim to minimize the distortion of the parameterization. An energy functional is proposed in the paper, that quantities angle and area distortions simultaneously, while the relative importance between angle and area preservation can be controlled by the user through a parameter. The method is based on an iterative procedure that incrementally flattens mesh by growing region to obtain a parameterization result with free boundary. The result is then converted to a parameterization with regular boundary by conformal mapping. Application of the method to texture mapping is presented. Experiments show that the proposed method can obtain better results than some common parameterization methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust and efficient surface flattening approach based on fitting a woven-like mesh model on a 3D freeform surface. The fitting algorithm is based on tendon node mapping (TNM) and diagonal node mapping (DNM), where TNM determines the position of a new node on the surface along the warp or weft direction and DNM locates a node along the diagonal direction. During the 3D fitting process, strain energy of the woven model is released by a diffusion process that minimizes the deformation between the resultant 2D pattern and the given surface. Nodes mapping and movement in the proposed approach are based on the discrete geodesic curve generation algorithm, so no parametric surface or pre-parameterization is required. After fitting the woven model onto the given surface, a continuous planar coordinate mapping is established between the 3D surface and its counterpart in the plane, based on the idea of geodesic interpolation of the mappings of the nodes in the woven model. The proposed approach accommodates surfaces with darts, which are commonly utilized in clothing industry to reduce the stretch of surface forming and flattening. Both isotropic and anisotropic materials are supported. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Optimized shotcrete application techniques are required in particular tunneling projects. Today, any spraying can be done by hand or by manipulator. With the development in the material technologies, the range of possible operation was enlarged. With automation of the application, an important contribution to improve performance and quality and to reduce rebound may be achieved. At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, systematic research is done to develop the fully automated process control, focusing on the wet shotcrete method. With the development of the fully automated shotcrete robot, the user will have a very effective tool at his or her disposal to spray concrete shells (fully automated). With the new robot, the user may choose from three different modes: manual, semiautomated, and fully automated spraying. Especially the fully automated mode facilitates higher performance with less danger to the worker's health. Quality control is inherent in the application process in regard to layer thickness, compaction, and homogeneity.},

Such machines are required to sense and interpret situations, plan strategies, and execute tasks with nearly absolute reliability. Negotiation of complex environments requires the use of a variety of different sensor types and the interpretation of conflicting or missing data, diagnosis of faulty sensors, and the ability to reconfigure a system to work with a partially inoperative sensor suite. This paper focuses on the issues of integration of information from disparate sensor types in the presence of noise and uncertainty. The application is a mobile robot called the autonomous navigation testbed being used at West Virginia University for research in mining robot applications.

Wireless sensor networks monitoring is an application that is very crucial for the safety of mine workers. These sensors can monitor vital life signs of workers which may be very useful during emergency situations. Localization and tracking of moving objects is an essential capacity for a sensor network in many applications. This paper studies the problem of localization in underground mines using ad-hoc sensor networks.

@article{opto,
abstract = {The success of automation applications in the mining industry traditionally has not been well. In many of these cases the benefits of automation have been advertised as the definitive solution to a wide variety of problems faced by the mining industry, such as increased safety and improved productivity. These applications have in many cases been introduced prematurely without adequate consideration of the rigors of the mining environment. As a result, effective technology has often been labeled as a failure before it has had a chance to demonstrate its true capability. Therefore, we believe that a major requirement is essential to develop automation technologies for mining systems or sub-systems, which needs minimal operator input requirement. This can be achieved in several ways. First, by narrowing the domain in which the automated mining system must operate such that less complex automation technology can be applied robustly. Alternately, more sophisticated control technologies are required that can react to the wider range of operating mining scenarios resulting from an uncertain, dynamic and very unstructured geological highly variable and unpredictable environment. Automation of shearer machines, with the help of an opto-tactile sensor, should make the machine capable to detect the coal-rock interface in the roof and the floor. In this article an attempt has been made to apply, in association with an existing shearer machine, a newly developed opt-tactile sensor to detect different types of material layers where a shearer machine can operate at the longwall face of underground coal mines. The proposed tactile sensor should be capable to detect different types of materials (coal, limestone, sandstone, and shell) recognizing their surface textures.},
