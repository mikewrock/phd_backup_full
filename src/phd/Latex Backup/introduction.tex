\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

The engineering goals of this work are twofold; not only was a robotic system designed, constructed, and tested to complete a specific set of tasks, it also must serve as a development platform for implementing and testing new algorithms. Though a primary requirement is to demonstrate a functional proof of concept prototype, the priority is to develop a system on which further research can be performed.\\

Most importantly this research aims to improve worker safety in underground uranium mines. It achieves this by not only removing workers from a hazardous environment but performing tasks (some of which directly related to establishing a safe environment) with greater accuracy, consistency, and measurability.\\

As this is a research project in a research institution, simply designing a functional prototype would not be sufficient. The prototype must also serve as a research tool for developing other novel solutions to the problems discussed herein or problems that may be entirely unrelated to this work but require a similar robotic system or software platform. Both the hardware and software in this work is intended to be as modular and reusable as possible to not limit the potential research that can be performed on the final product.\\

The hardware designs in this work aims not to replace existing hardware, but to mimic it. Choosing equipment capable of functioning in the harsh conditions of an underground uranium mine would add significant cost to the project. Instead, hardware was selected such that it had equivalent functionality but lacked the appropriate characteristics to endure the conditions it would be exposed to in the mine. As well, the mock mine constructed for testing is one third the scale of the real mine, meaning the robotic system was also designed at the same scale.\\

The software framework developed in this work the most significant contribution of this research. If implemented on existing or novel hardware specifically intended for use in a mine, minimal modification to the code is required. One simply needs to replace the hardware drivers used with the appropriate drivers for the hardware used. The algorithms and implementation is highly modular and capable of performing on a wide variety of hardware systems. Moreover, the software was designed in such a way that it can be used in applications entirely unrelated to this work with no modification to the code.\\

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:prob}
The most crucial problem this work is trying to address is worker safety. It attempts to solve this problem in a way that is most conducive to continuing research. Specifically the scenario this work is intended to improve is underground uranium drift mining. First an explanation of underground drift mining is necessary, followed by a discussion of the additional dangers a radioactive ore presents. With an understanding of the current state of the art, the problem statement can be presented.\\

\subsection{Underground Drift Mining}

A drift is simply a mining term to describe a nearly horizontal passageway within a mine. The drifts usually follow an ore vein, allowing the miners to extract ore as the drift progresses. Prospecting drifts may intersect the ore body, but drifts are more commonly used to provide access areas of the mine where other mining methods are employed. Two methods of mining that require drifts can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:raisebore} and \ref{fig:boxhole}. These methods use the drifts to position the mining equipment above or below the ore body for extraction. Drifts are also used to place freeze lines in order to create a freeze wall that prevents the mine from flooding (as seen in Figure \ref{fig:boxhole}).\\

Drifts are typically created using the drill and blast method. Drills are used to create holes into which explosives are placed. After detonation the blasted rock is removed and the mine is reinforced. Rock bolts and mesh are applied to the mine surface, followed by an application of a sprayable concrete liner called shotcrete. When small sections of the mine are modified the rock bolts and mesh may be omitted, relying on the shotcrete alone for reinforcement.\\

When mining uranium ore the shotcrete reinforcement serves two purposes. First and foremost, the shotcrete reinforces the mine and prevents rock-fall. Reinforcement is necessary to prevent the workers from getting crushed or trapped should the mine collapse, and prevent loose rock from falling and injuring the workers. However, in a uranium mine the shotcrete serves an additional purpose: protection from radiation and radon gas. As uranium decays it produces multiple types of radiation and radioactive products. Among these products is an odourless and colourless radioactive gas called radon. Inhalation of radon gas and it's progeny has been shown to increase the rate of lung cancer in uranium mine workers \cite{radon}. For this reason shotcrete must be applied to all surfaces of the mine unlike typical mines that do not require application of shotcrete to the drift face.\\

\subsection{Surface Scanning}

Since naturally occurring uranium ore has a known radiation signature, the ore concentration can be determined by measuring the radiation energy emitted. This radiation energy is harmful to those exposed to it, so workers attempt to maximize their distance from the ore when protection from a layer of shotcrete is not available. If the drift intersects the ore body, geologists may want to inspect the drift face containing ore. To do so they use a radiation sensor such as a Geiger-M{\"u}ller counter mounted on the end of a long pole (to maximize their distance from the radioactive ore). This method is crude at best, the geologists are not able to position the sensors with very high accuracy or record the position at which they've taken the measurement. The measurements themselves lack accuracy as well, since the radiation sensors currently in use are unshielded and yield measurements in a cone shaped region originating at the sensor. The use of a shielded sensor can narrow the beam angle which the sensor detects radiation, allowing the geologist a higher resolution scan of the drift face (provided they are able to accurately aim and record the position of the sensor at the time of measurement. A higher resolution scan can provide geologists with a more accurate representation of the ore body, allowing further insight in developing models to represent and predict uranium ore deposits.\\


\subsection{Shotcrete Reinforcement}

Shotcrete is applied after rock bolts and mesh are applied to the drift surface. The rock bolts are driven deep in to the rock to hold the rock mesh securely to the surface. The rock mesh provides additional support and protection from falling rock before the shotcrete is applied. As well, the rock mesh provides additional strength to the shotcrete layer.\\

The work instructions for applying wet shotcrete in Cameco's MacArthur River underground uranium mine can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:shotcreteapp}. The instructions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clean The area
\item Wash the surface
\item Clear the lines
\item Apply shotcrete
\end{itemize}

Cleaning the area is necessary because foreign objects and dirt between the shotcrete layer and the mine surface will lower the amount of adhesion, possibly leading to shagging (sections of shotcrete detaching from the mine surface). Even with ideal application technique there is still likely to be rebound. When particles of shotcrete do not adhere to the surface they can bounce off it, forming rebound. The shotcrete rebound can land on equipment potentially causing damage, which is why all services (air, water, electrical cables/boxes etc.) must be protected or cleared from the area as well. Washing the surface not only clears debris but ensures the surface is moist before shotcrete application, reducing the risk of low hydration causing cracking and improving adhesion. Finally, before application the shotcrete lines must be cleared of the ``slick'' material left in the lines. Once cleared the operator can begin applying shotcrete provided they have achieved the correct shotcrete mix and application settings.\\

    \label{fig:instshot}
\end{figure}

To apply shotcrete the operator must begin at the bottom of the area and work their way up to the top, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:instshot}. When applying shotcrete, the distance from and angle to the surface have a significant effect on the amount of rebound. The relationship between offset, angle, and rebound is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rebound}. The instructions describe the maximum attainable layer thickness given the specific shotcrete mix used, to achieve a thicker shotcrete layer the operator must wait 30 minutes before applying another layer. The work instructions do not include a method of estimating the shotcrete layer thickness.\\

\subsection{Shotcrete Thickness}

Sufficient thickness of the shotcrete layer is essential in ensuring worker safety. Not only is the shotcrete required to protect the workers from radiation and radon gas, but it is responsible for providing structural support in the mine. There are both destructive and non-destructive methods of measuring shotcrete thickness, but often it is simply estimated by the operator. For this reason more shotcrete than necessary is used to ensure a factor of safety, since the visual estimation of the operator may not be very accurate, even less so with novice operators.\\
